pmpro-members-only-levels
=========================

A plugin for Paid Memberships Pro to configure a subset of membership levels to be visible only to existing members.

This is a quick hack: memberships with "1 year" in the name are hidden from anyone not logged in. Next step is to configure this via a setting on the memberships page.
